Basin_net_2d.py is the simulation code for the second case study. To run it, you need to load both of initial training data and MC simulation data. See the comment at the beginging in the code.

The variable __path_file__ is the path for initial training data and __path100__ is the path for MC simulation data. You need to modifiy them accordingly.
